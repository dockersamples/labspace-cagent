# Step 3: Builtin Tools

An agent on its own can't do much other than just chat with you. To make agents
more useful we need to give the agent tools that it can use to gather
information and execute actions.

`Docker Agent` has builtin tools and also support for MCP (Model Context Protocol).

## Builtin tools

`Docker Agent` has 3 builtin generic agentic tools:

- `think`
- `todo`
- `memory`

### Think

The `think` tool gives the model the ability to stop and think. It's a kind of a
whiteboard that the model can use to jot down its thoughts.

Read more about the thinking tool
[here](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool).

To use this tool, add the `type: think` tool to the toolset of your agent. 

1. Create a new agent in the `think_agent.yaml` file with the following content:

    ```yaml save-as=think_agent.yaml
    version: "2"

    agents:
      root:
        model: $$model$$
        instruction: You talk like a pirate
        toolsets:
          - type: think
    ```

2. Run the agent:

    ```bash
    docker agent run think_agent.yaml
    ```

3. Try thinking by asking your pirate agent: 

    ```bash
    Think before you answer, where is the treasure map?
    ```

The keen-eyed might have noticed the `version: "2"` on the top of the YAML file
above. While `Docker Agent` is in active development and breaking things, we _try_ not
to break user's existing agents. If there is no version defined in the YAML
file, the default version is `0`. The current latest version is `2`. Always try to use
the latest version.

### Memory

The memory tool gives the agent the ability to remember things about the user.

1. Create a new agent by defining a `memory_agent.yaml` file with the following contents:

    ```yaml save-as=memory_agent.yaml
    version: "2"

    agents:
      root:
        model: $$model$$
        instruction: You are a personal assistant
        toolsets:
          - type: memory
            path: ./memory.db
    ```

2. Run the agent:

    ```bash
    docker agent run memory_agent.yaml
    ```

3. Tell it your name and some random fact about you. Something like:

    ```console
    I'm John and I'm a software engineer
    ```
    
    You should see it calling the memory tools to remember facts about you.

4. Quit the agent by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

5. Start a new session with this agent:

    ```bash
    docker agent run memory_agent.yaml
    ```

6. Ask it what it knows about you. It should correctly look up its internal memory and tell you what it knows. For example: 

    ```console
    Who am I and what do I do for a living?
    ```

### Todo

The `todo` toolset instructs the model to use its todo-tracking tools when it
needs to do a complex task. This tool can help the model keep in line while it's
working on a complex task.

The `todo` toolset can be useful for a developer agent. Breaking down a task
into smaller, more manageable pieces is how most developers work. Let's start
creating our developer agent right now. 

1. Create a `developer.yaml` file with the following contents:

    ```yaml save-as=developer.yaml
    version: "2"

    agents:
      root:
        model: $$model$$
        instruction: You are an amazing developer
        toolsets:
          - type: todo
    ```

2. Run the agent:

    ```bash
    docker agent run developer.yaml
    ```

3. Try this agent, see how it _magically_ creates todo lists for its tasks and
loops until the todos are done.

### Development Related Builtin Tools

The agents can be given access to your shell or your filesystem to run
commands or read/write files or directories.

- `shell`
- `filesystem`

Let's enhance our developer agent with these tools. 

1. Update the `developer.yaml` file to now have the following contents:

    ```yaml save-as=developer.yaml
    version: "2"

    agents:
      root:
        model: $$model$$
        instruction: You are an amazing developer
        toolsets:
          - type: todo
          - type: shell
          - type: filesystem
    ```

    This is basically all it takes to have a basic developer agent. 
    
2. Try it out:

    ```bash
    docker agent run developer.yaml
    ```

3. Ask the agent to create a web-based version of snake:

    ```console
    Write a snake game in an index.html file
    ```

## Extra

This developer agent is a good start, but there's one piece missing that
would make it even better. It doesn't really know anything about the environment
it is working in. It _could_ find it out by running shell scripts, but that's
just wasting tokens. `docker agent` can automatically add information about the
environment the agent is working on by adding `add_environment_info: true` to the
agent definition:

```yaml save-as=developer.yaml
version: "2"

agents:
  root:
    model: $$model$$
    instruction: You are an amazing developer
    add_environment_info: true
    toolsets:
      - type: todo
      - type: shell
      - type: filesystem
```

Run this agent again:

```bash
docker agent run developer.yaml
```

Ask it what the current directory is or if the current directory is a git repository. The agent now knows this without having to make any tool calls. Neat!

The information that is added to its system prompt with this is:

- the current directory
- the current platform (Windows, Linux, etc.)
- information if the current directory is a git repository or not

If you think that your agent needs to know what the current date is, you can add
this to its system prompt too:

```yaml save-as=developer.yaml
version: "2"

agents:
  root:
    model: $$model$$
    instruction: You are an amazing developer
    add_environment_info: true
    add_date: true
    toolsets:
      - type: todo
      - type: shell
      - type: filesystem
```

Run this agent again:

```bash
docker agent run developer.yaml
```


This can be useful if you are planning on asking your agent questions like `What were the commits made in this repository in the last day?`



## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific in Instructions**: Tell agents how to use their tools
   effectively
2. **Combine Complementary Tools**: Think + filesystem, shell + todo, etc.
3. **Consider Security**: Be careful with shell access and file permissions
4. **Start Simple**: Begin with one tool, then add more as needed

## Next Steps

In the next step we will take a look at ways we can make our developer agent
even more powerful thanks to MCP servers.

> **Note:** Before going to the next step, play around with your developer agent, try and make its system prompt fit _your_ needs.
