# Labspace - Getting Started with Docker Agent

Welcome to this labspace on building intelligent agents using Docker Agent! This workshop will take you from basic agent concepts to building sophisticated multi-agent teams that can handle complex real-world tasks.

## Learning objectives

In this workshop we will learn:

- How to create simple agents with Docker Agent
- How to use built-in generaic agentic tools
- How cagent makes it easy to use an MCP server from the MCP Toolkit.
- How to share agents with Docker Registry
- When and how to use Multi-agent system
- Using Docker Model Runner with Docker Agent - Work-in-progress



## Launch the Labspace

To launch the lab, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f oci://dockersamples/labspace-docker-agent up
```
 
and then open your browser to [https://localhost:3030](https://localhost:3030)

### Using the Docker Desktop extension

If you have the Labspace extension installed (`docker extension install dockersamples/labspace-extension` if not), you can also click [this link](https://open.docker.com/dashboard/extension-tab?extensionId=dockersamples/labspace-extension&location=dockersamples/labspace-docker-agent&title=docker-agent) to launch the Labspace.

1. Clone this repo

2. Start the Labspace in content development mode:

    ```bash
    # On Mac/Linux
    CONTENT_PATH=$PWD docker compose up --watch

    # On Windows with PowerShell
    $Env:CONTENT_PATH = (Get-Location).Path; docker compose up --watch
    ```

3. Open the Labspace at http://localhost:3030.

4. Make the necessary changes and validate they appear as you expect in the Labspace
